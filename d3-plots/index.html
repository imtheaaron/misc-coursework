					<h3>Diabetes and Median Income Correlation</h3>
					<p><strong>Data: </strong>We gathered data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Behavioral Risk Factors, and looked specifically at 2016
					data showing the revalence of diabetes by state. We then gathered 2016 Census data for median household income by state. Income data is plotted
				along the x-axis, while the percentage of the population in each state that has received a diagnosis of diabetes in plotted along the y-axis.</p>
				<p><strong>Analysis: </strong>A fairly strong inverse correlation can be seen between income and diabetes rate, with those states lower on the median
				income range having a higher prevalence of diabetes in their populations. And while the data appears to have a strong correlation at diabetes rates of 10.5% and higher,
				at lower rates the spread of median incomes is more broad - indicating that perhaps diabetes rates are only strongly tied to income at median income levels below
				$55,000 / yr.</p>
